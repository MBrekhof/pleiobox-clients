Pleiobox clients
================
This repository provides the native client apps (iOS and Android) for Pleiobox. The apps are build on top of the [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com) platform.

Fork
----
This project is a fork of the [Localbox project](http://www.wijdelenveilig.org/). The central argument to maintain an own fork is to deliver an integrated user experience to our users. One of our goals is to remain API compatible with other Localbox backends.
